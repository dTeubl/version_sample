Just a few thing to show some data here.

Notes
-----

There is a problem with the fresh TAGs and their commits. If a tag is fresh, then the vX.Y-N-g1a3b5c7 version number is not generated by the current process.

With a fresh TAG, the "git describe --contains" command could be used. With that the commit hash is still missing...

It is not possible to rewrite a file in an already existing commit !! So if you creating a new tag, you will have problems with it, More problems, id the commit is already pushed to somewhere.

Workaround:
+ Before a fresh TAG, one must create a new commit, and before the commit, you should rewrite the *N* number in the right source file to a specific value, which will signal the pre-commit script, that this value should be written as zero.
--> The problem with that is, that is not automatic!!!

Also it is not possible to use the "--amend" option on an already TAG-ed commit.

We should create a script/program/something, which wraps these function together:

+ Modify the right number of in the config file - which indicates the build number
+ Creating a new commit
+ Calls git tag -a 
+ Let us write a correct tag msg.

With that, and a well written pre-commit script/program, the version management with correct build numbers could be set up. --> The source files under a given HASH code will give the same build number as "git describe" should give us.
